This is the 6th project in Udacity's Robotics Nanodegree Program

#### About

The focus of this project was Robotics Inference.
By utilising NVIDIA'S (awsome) DIGITS platform, creating a classifier or object detector to solve a real-life problem was required. Each student had to think of a problem and create the solution using those tools.

### Short Summary
In my project i discuss a classifier that would be deployed on a drone and would automatically navigate orchard. This is part of a larger project that i am working on my PhD thesis, and since this part does not have any copy-right restrictions, i decided to use for this project.
